# CrosCrowd-Creative

https://croscrowdcreative.com/

A static website (HTML, CSS, Javascript) for a small business called CrosCrowd Creative. The website is deployed automatically on Netlify using Github. Animations were modeled and keyframed in Autodesk Maya with some Python scripting and rendered with Redshift. Still frames were made with Autodesk Maya and Adobe Creative Suite.

CrosCrowd Creative is a business specializing in web development and content creation for small businesses looking to expand their online presence. Services include full-stack solutions as well as creative digital marketing campaigns.

As the company scales the website will need more functionality. To achieve that, I created a seperate repository for this website using Django. Django allows me to utilize different apps (Web Dev, Advertising, Consulting) to properly document and search for seperate projects as well as securely store customer information.
